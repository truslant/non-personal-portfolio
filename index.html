                <p>
                    Hi! I'm Bob, Beginner Coder at Codecademy course and am an imaginary projection of self-reflective person, chiefly known for my lack of professional coding skills, but working on getting there with all my heart and willpower, which are the only helpful assets at my current challange I possess at the moment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am one of the last to recognize that I was wrong not to engage into programming and computer science studies beyond pure gaming, and not to have continued my initial programming skill development interest during the high school period.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nowadays, in order to catch up, in my out of work and free time I spend all the available hours (beyond family and sport time) studying the “Full-stack development” Codecademy course. I hope to finally develop an ability to create at least at this stage on my life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fun fact! Theoretically, I could have been a professional coder for the last <span id="timer">XX</span> seconds by now!
                </p>

            <p>Good course! Very well structured, but unfortunantly mostly theoretical course lacking practical excercises and code challanges...</p>

            <p>Excellent and meticulously built course! Very well balanced between theory and practice! Great volume of theory as well as excercises and code challanges! But very lengthy as well - so be prepared!</p>
